First thing to fix:
  1) Make an AJAX call that connects the button to the route (just do a simple get route)
  1.5) If there is a problem, remove the access levels just to render the pages that you need for the routes. 
  2) If you don't know how to do this, just research up on the FORM /GET for handlebars that magically does something

If this fails:
  1) Make simple routes that will just render the page that you need after clicking and sending it through the login button through an <a href>

Nice things if you fix all this:
  1) Connect the data that is in the database to display to the route pages that is going.
